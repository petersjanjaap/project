#day 2
- built a script in Python to use API's from the World Bank to convert and save the data in JSON-format.
- working on a script to import GDP info for countries
- I limited the scope of the subject to trade flows of the UK with the world, because otherwise the dataset would become to large, namely > 9  million obs

#day 3
- finished the API-script in Python to download all data. Trade data and data on GDP components for all countries worldwide is now complete.
- created basic layout for the website, including svg's for all visualizations and buttons for navigation around the page.
